OKay, each world, view and projection matrix is related to each individual unit on the screen. But the "mesh" is being reused. The vertex shader is rendering each unit using
a preset mesh. All I have to do is figure out where that mesh is stored, make a model class?? to load in mesh's from maya .obj files and then create a "box" model or a 
sphere model???

Is texturing model dependent or unit dependent??

Also how the fuck do I change the colors?

The color should be set by the unit and not by the mesh, mutiple color's per mesh

Add each constant buffer to the array
